## Finding items in a list of objects

### By direct property
If you want to filter by a **direct key of an object**, you can use the `key` option.

```ts title="index.ts"
const list = [
  { name: "volvo", year: 2020 },
  { name: "seat", year: 2019 },
  { name: "mercedes", year: 2021 },
]

const fuzzySearch = fuzzy(list, {
  // search by `name` property as it's not nested
  key: 'name',
})
```

### By nested property
If you want to filter by a nested property of an object, you can use the `getKey` option.

```ts title="index.ts"
const list = [
  { name: "volvo", year: 2020, owner: { fullname: "John Doe" } },
  { name: "seat", year: 2019, owner: { fullname: "Jane Doe" } },
  { name: "mercedes", year: 2021, owner: { fullname: "John Smith" } },
]

const fuzzySearch = fuzzy(list, {
  // search by `owner.fullname` property (John Doe as example)
  getKey: (item) => [item.owner.fullname],
})
```

### By multiple properties
If you want to filter by multiple properties of an object, you can use the `getKey` option. 

```ts title="index.ts"
const list = [
  { name: "volvo", year: 2020, owner: { fullname: "John Doe" } },
  { name: "seat", year: 2019, owner: { fullname: "Jane Doe" } },
  { name: "mercedes", year: 2021, owner: { fullname: "John Smith" } },
]

const fuzzySearch = fuzzy(list, {
  // search by `name` and `owner.fullname` properties (John Doe as example)
  getKey: (item) => [item.name, item.owner.fullname],
})
```

For further examples check the **Examples** section.
