description: Fast, simple but complete fuzzy finder algorithm
---

## Summary

After losing some afternoons trying to create a **fuzzy finder** for a side project, I decided to export it  
as an open-source library that could help me (and other devs) with filters in the future.

I wanted to create a library that fits perfectly for filters, selects,  
autocompletes, navigate commands, etc. 

The main goal was to create a library that is:
- Easy to use.
- Framework-agnostic without dependencies.
- Fast, should filter thousands of items in milliseconds.
- Lightweight. Less than 2kb.
- Case-insensitive and diacritics-insensitive.
- Returns the matched positions and points of each result.

This is how **@polgubau/fuzzy** ended up being an optimized library designed with TypeScript from the roots. You just need to type  
one command and call one function to get a fuzzy finder for your project.

### What this is NOT ⚠️

- A library that tries to do everything.
- A monolithic package with a lot of features you don't need.
- A complete Filter library.

### What this IS ✅

- A small direct library that solves a specific problem.
- A helper for your filters and lists.
- A library that is easy to use and understand.
- Open source without a pricing tag in the navbar.
