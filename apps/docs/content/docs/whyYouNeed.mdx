title: Why you need fuzzy search?
description: Discover the benefits of integrating fuzzy search into your applications.

A Fuzzy finder is a **complex search algorithm** that allows you to find items in a list even if the **search term is not an exact match**. It can handle typos, partial matches, and variations in spelling, making it a powerful tool for improving user experience in applications where users need to search for items quickly and efficiently.


It is particularly useful in applications with large datasets, where users may not remember the exact name of the item they are looking for. By implementing a fuzzy finder, you can help users find what they need faster and with less frustration.


## Benefits of Fuzzy Search
| Topic | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Improved User Experience | Fuzzy search allows users to find items even if they make typos or don't remember the exact name. |
| Increased Efficiency | Users can find what they need faster, reducing the time spent searching for items. |
| Enhanced Flexibility | Fuzzy search can handle variations in spelling and partial matches, making it more versatile than traditional search algorithms. |
| Better Search Results | Fuzzy search improves the accuracy of search results by considering similar terms and synonyms. |


## Example
Let's compare a traditional javascript filter with a fuzzy search algorithm.
