# Wisemark monorepo

Your TODOs, with deadline. And consequences.

Wisemark is a simple and powerful standard to manage your code comments. It allows to:

1. Track your TODOs, FIXMEs, and other comments in your code.
2. Set deadlines for your TODOs and FIXMEs.
3. Fail pipelines if you have overdue comments.
4. Generate reports of your comments.

Haven't you ever found forgot comments in legacy code? Or have you ever had to deal with a TODO that was never done? Wisemark is here to help you.

Main usage:

```ts
// @question What if the numbers are negative?
function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  // @todo Add a test for negative numbers
  return a + b;
}
```

Using the main types:
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| @todo | A task that needs to be done. |
| @fixme | A critical issue that needs fixing. |
| @note | A note or comment. |
| @question | A question that needs answering. |
| @refactor | A suggestion to improve the code. |

Wisemark will automatically detect these comments and allow you to manage them.
![Scan Command](https://github.com/PolGubau/wisemark/blob/readme-update/packages/vscode/public/example.png?raw=true)
This is the usual output using the VSCode extension.

## Packages

- [@wisemark/core](packages/core): The core library for Wisemark. It provides the main functionality and API for managing comments.
- [@wisemark/cli](packages/cli): The command-line interface for Wisemark. It allows you to run Wisemark commands from the terminal.
- [@wisemark/vscode](packages/vscode): The VSCode extension for Wisemark. It provides a user interface for managing comments directly in the editor.

# Creating Wisemark Comments

A comment can be as simple as:

```ts
// @<type> <message>
```

Examples:

```ts name="Example.ts"
// @todo Add a test for negative numbers
// @fixme Fix the bug in the code
// @note This is a note
// @question What if the numbers are negative?
// @refactor Refactor this function
```

Some optional parameters can be added to the comment:

- severity: low, medium, high
- tags: any string separated by commas
- author: the author of the comment
- due: the due date of the comment (YYYY-MM-DD)
- id: A unique name for the comment (its generated automatically but you can override it)

Structure of the comment:

````ts
// @<type> <message> -- severity: <severity> -- tags: <tags> -- author: <author> -- due: <due> -- id: <id>
```

```ts title="Example.ts"
// @todo Add a test for negative numbers -- severity: high -- tags: bug, urgent -- author: Pol Gubau -- due: 2023-10-01 -- id: test-negative-numbers

// @fixme Fix the bug in the code -- severity: medium -- tags: bug,correct
````

# CLI Tool

Wisemark CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to manage your comments directly from the terminal. It provides commands for scanning your codebase, generating reports, and managing your TODOs and FIXMEs. (Report generation is not yet implemented)

### Remote or Local Installation

#### Remote Run

If you don't want to install Wisemark in you computer just run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx @wisemark/cli
```

#### Local Installation

You can install Wisemark CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @wisemark/cli
```

### Usage

Once installed, you can use the following commands:

#### Scan Wisemark Commands

This command scans your codebase for Wisemark comments and generates a report of all the TODOs, FIXMEs, and other comments.
Can be triggered with the default command `wisemark` or `wisemark scan`.

```bash
wisemark [options]
```

```bash
wisemark lint [options]
```

#### Options

For these both commands you can use the following options:

    The optional options are:

- `--type`: Filter by type (todo, note, fixme)
- `--path`: Inner path of the project to scan (default: `.`)
- `--severity`: Filter by severity (low, medium, high)
- `--json`: Return output in JSON format
- `--table`: Return output in table format
- `--showDate`: Show the date of the comment
- `--withDueDate`: Return only comments with a due date
- `--due`: Filter by due date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `--tags`: Filter by tags (comma separated)
- `--cwd`: Path to the project (default: current working directory)
- `--help`: Show help information
- `--version`: Show version information

A full example of the command would be:

```bash
wisemark --type todo --path src --severity high --json --showDate --withDueDate --due 2023-10-01 --tags bug,urgent
```
