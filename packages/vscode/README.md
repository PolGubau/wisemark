  - Fixme
  - Question
  - Refactor
- **Command Scanning**: Scan and manage your project for specific commands with a quick search functionality.
- **Grouping**: Toggle grouping of comments for better organization.
- **Color Customization**: Different colors for each comment type (Note, Todo, etc.) to make your comments more visually distinguishable.
